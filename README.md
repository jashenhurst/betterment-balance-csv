I've been a Betterment customer and a Mint customer since 2013. At some point, Mint had some issue syncing with Betterment, resulting in Mint losing my balance history prior to 2018 for my Betterment accounts. And now, Intuit has announced the end-of-life of Mint, so I've been downloading my data from Mint as CSVs and loading the balance history into a new tool, and I started wondering, I wonder how I could get all the balance history from Betterment into the new tool?

So I was poking around the Betterment site. I couldn't find a way to download the balance history as a CSV. But I was looking at the performance graph for my accounts and thinking, that's all the data I need, just in graph form, so how do I get it?

I looked through the source for the website around where the code for the performance graph is written, and a little below that is a `<script>` block with all the variables the page uses to draw the graph. It's all the balance history but as JavaScript variables. So I manually copied and pasted everything in the `script` tag from each account's performance page into text files. Then I spent about four hours writing some Python code to convert those text files into CSV format.
